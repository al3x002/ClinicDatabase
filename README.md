This is a simple database that concerns the creation of a management system for a medical clinic. The database will be used to store data about doctors, patients, 
visits, employees, wards and the results of medical examinations. The system allows you to register visits, prescribing patients to doctors, monitoring diagnoses, 
and analyzing statistics on the tests carried out. 

The database contains 6 tables, 2 views. In addition, an example function, procedure, and trigger is provided.

This is what the tables do:
1. The 'Doctors' table shall store information about doctors, such as their first name, last name and
specialization.
2. The "Patients" table contains data about patients, including name, surname, social security number and address.
3. The "Visits" table shall record information about visits, including doctor, patient, date,
time and diagnosis.
4. The "Employees" table stores data about the clinic's employees, such as name,
name and job title.
5. The "Departments" table contains information about the departments of the clinic, including the name and
Location.
6. The "Research" table records the results of medical examinations, including the patient, doctor,
type of test and result.
